### Opting-in on FXDX

In order to perform any actions (trading or providing liquidity) on our non-custodial platform, you must opt-in for all the smart contracts and algorand smart assets (ASA) related to FXDX. 

These include:

- 17 smart contracts 
- 3 ASAs - WALGO, USDC, USDt

### Minimum Balance Requirement

Whenever a user opt-in for smart contracts and ASAs, the minimum balance requirement increases. Users on FXDX must have minimum of 10 ALGOs in their wallet in order to trade or provide liquidity. For more information, check [here](https://developer.algorand.org/docs/get-details/parameter_tables/?from_query=minimum%20#minimum-balance). 


## Trading 

If a user wants to start trading on FXDX after connecting his/her wallet, he/she needs to opt-in to following:

### Vault App

The user needs to enter the amount of collateral they want to start trading with (minimum collateral size is $10), we are using 30 ALGOs in this example as shown:

![Vault Contract Opt-in](/vaultoptin.JPG)

Click the button and confirm the transaction from your wallet. 

Once you have confirmed, you will receive an alert saying "Vault App Approved" upon success. Now we have approved FXDX Vault contract, lets continue to next opt-in. 

### WALGO ASA

FXDX uses its native ASA called WALGO (Wrapped ALGO) in order to execute and settle trades efficiently. All users have to opt-in to WALGO for proper trade execution and settlement.

Once you have confirmed, you will receive an alert saying "WALGO Approved" upon success. Now we have approved FXDX WALGO ASA, lets continue to next opt-in. 

### Position App

If the user is interested in opening a ***long*** position, which settles the ***profits in ALGO***, needs to opt-in to Position App as "Create Position App" button shown below:

![Positionoptin](/positionoptin.JPG)

Once you have confirmed, you will receive an alert saying "Position App Created for XYZ" upon success. In case of long position, XYZ would be "WALGO Long" and in case of short position, XYZ would be "WALGO Short". For short positions, please check the next section as user is required to opt-in to additional ASA.

### Position App For Short Position

If the user is interested in opening a ***short*** position, which settles the ***profits in USDC***, user must opt-in to USDC ASA if they have not already opted-in from previous Dapp interactions.

Once you have confirmed, you will receive an alert saying "USDC Approved" upon success. Now the user needs to approve the Position App as shown [above](#position-app). 

### Opening a position

By default, if a user has opted-in for WALGO, he/she can open long position using ALGO as collateral. If a user wishes to provide USDC as collateral, he/she needs to opt-in to USDC ASA as mention in the section above. 

Now that the user has opted-in for necessary contracts and ASAs, he/she is ready to place his/her desired order. 

### Long Position

User is required to opt-in following as explained in earlier section:

- Vault App
- WALGO ASA
- Position App

Once all the above are approved, user needs to select the desired amount of collateral he/she wants to put and the leverage he/she wants to take. For this example, we are taking 30 ALGOs as collateral and opening a position with 10x leverage. 

![long](https://github.com/fxdxdex/howto/blob/f11b17482a44ae9c78e39fce94935620c9e38abb/long.JPG)

One should carefully note the following before placing an order:

-Type of Order - Market or Limit
-Amount of Collateral 
-Type of Collateral - ALGO, USDC, USDt
-Leverage - 1.1 to 30.5x
-Total Notional Size (Collateral * Leverage) = (This amount - Collateral) would be reserved in the pool's avaliable for securing position.
-Entry Price 
-Liquidation Price - Price at which liquidation protocol would close the position if the (collateral + trading fee + borrow fees) < 0. For a long position, it would be lower than entry price.

In case a user is going for Limit Order, he/she need to put their desired Entry Price as well.
